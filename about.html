  <p id = "paragraphDecocration" >
  First of all, let's start with my education. 
  I am an undergraduate student who majors in Computer Science at The City College of New York with good 
  knowledge of data structure and algorithms skills.  I have fundamental knowledge of 
  web development and Software Engineering. Currently, I am also taking a class which teaches me the 
  fundamentals of android developments.
  
  <br>
  <br>
  I am an optimistic person and I like to accept any kind of challenges. 
  This is why I joined Wrestling team in my high school because I heard people say Wrestling is very challenging. 
  While I was on the team, I learned the mindset of not to give up regardless of any situation. 
  Everything can be solved just by simply not giving up and working hard.  During my personal time, 
  I love to watch movies and listen to music and sometimes I like to watch some algorithms videos on Youtube.
